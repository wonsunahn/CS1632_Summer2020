# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance

## Exercise 3

For this assignment, you and a partner will write a systems-level, automated black-box tests for the Reddit website using the Selenium IDE.  Specifically, we are going to test the r/cats subreddit at:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/

It was chosen because it is a nice safe subreddit which is policed pretty well.  Besides, it's cats.

First, let's start by adding the Selenium IDE browser extension for your web browser by selecting "Chrome Download" or "Firefox Download" on the below website:

https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/

Then, open Selenium IDE by clicking on the newly created browser extension with
the "Se" symbol.  You should see a pop up window that looks very similar to the
one shown on the lecture slides.

Write a test case for each requirement listed in [requirements.md](requirements.md).

Remember, each test must end with an assertion!  The list of available assertions and other commands are available at:

https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands

## Assertion for each Test

You will want to use the below commands and assertions to test each of the requirements:

FUN-TITLE: "assert title"

FUN-JOIN-BUTTON-EXISTS - "assert text"

FUN-SIGNUP-LINK - "store attribute" followed by "assert".  You will be storing the attribute value to a Selenium variable and asserting on the value of that variable.  Now there is a defect in Selenium IDE with the "store attribute" command where the target selector button is disabled when it should be enabled.  A work around is to enter a command such as "assert text" or "click" which allows you to use the target selector, fill in the locator string using it, and then revert to "store attribute".  As I said, while Selenium web driver is very mature, Selenium IDE is a work in progress. :)

FUN-SEARCH-SMELLY-CAT - "assert text"

FUN-RULE-3 - "assert text"

FUN-RULES-11-ITEMS - "assert element present" for the 11th item; "assert element not present" for the locator for the 12th item.

## Tips

Sometimes your test case will not work as expected.  Here are a few hints on how to debug a problem:

1. Check the Log window at the bottom of the Selenium IDE.  It will tell you
   which step failed for what reason (in red).

1. Select the test step that failed in the main test case window, and then
   select the Reference tab at the bottom pane of the IDE.  It will display
usage instructions for that command.  Remember always, the first argument goes to the Target field and the second argument goes to the Value field, regardless of command.

1. Sometimes the target component of a test step is the problem.  The selector
   button tries to generate a locator string as best it can using xpath, css
selector, or id tag.  But it is not fool proof.  The problem is, the web page
may change ever so slightly on the next page load (e.g. due to a new post, or a
new comment) and then the locator will stop working.  You will notice that
there is a small down arrow at the end of the target text box.  If you click on
that arrow, you will see alternative locator strings to the current string.
Select the one that looks specific enough to be able to point to the target but
also general enough to not change between page loads.  You do need to try this
out several times to get a feel of what a good locator string is.  Here is an
in-depth discussion about locators:  

   https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started_with_webdriver/locating_elements/#element-selection-strategies

1. Sometimes you can use an XPATH position locator string to check that an
   element exists at an expected location ("assert element present") or does
not exist ("assert element not present").  But to do this, you have to select
the XPath position locator string in the drop-down list of optional strings in
the Target field.

1. For those of you who are working in groups, you will be working on the same
   shared .side project file. So it is especially important that your pull
before opening the project file and push immediately after you have modified
and saved the project file. Otherwise, you may get merge conflicts. Merging
conflicts is possible by using the technique I went over with the
[Using\_Git](https://github.com/wonsunahn/CS1632_Summer2020/blob/master/lectures/Using_Git.pdf)
slides, but it's best to avoid it.

## Try this out

Once you are done writing your Selenium test suite, let's try exporting a test
suite in Selenium IDE to a Java JUnit test class.  Let's first try the "Export"
feature with the [Reddit Cats.side](Reddit%20Cats.side) project file provided
to you.  Save your current project and open the provided file.

Then follow these instructions:

1. Choose "Test Suites" from the left panel drop down menu.
1. Right click on "RedditCats" (or click on the vertical-3-dot context menu button).
1. Select "Export" in the context menu.
1. Select "Java JUnit" in the list of language options and leave all checkboxes unchecked.
1. Save the resulting file into "RedditCatsTest.java" in the current directory.

You can now run the RedditCatsTest JUnit class using the provided
[TestRunner.java](TestRunner.java) using one of the following scripts:

* If you are running Windows:
   ```
   cd Windows
   run.bat
   ```
* If you are running Mac:
   ```
   cd Mac
   run.sh
   ```
* If you are running Linux:
   ```
   cd Linux
   run.sh
   ```

Note that the script only works if you have Chrome version 83 installed on your
computer (the most recent version as of today).  If you have a different
version of Chrome, you may have to update the chromedriver.exe in your
respective OS folder (Windows / Mac / Linux) by downloading a new Chrome Web
Driver from:

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

If things go properly, you will see the Chrome browser pop up repeatedly for
each test case, perform the actions, and close.  In the command line, you
should see "ALL TESTS PASSED" as usual.

You may optionally try now opening your own Selenium IDE project file and
exporting your test suite.  You will have to export your JUnit test to the file
RedditCatsTest.java like I did, or you may have to modify TestRunner.java so
that it runs your test class.

There are multiple reasons why you would want to export to JUnit:

1. You may have a pre-existing testing framework in JUnit (or Python Pytest, or
   JavaScript Mocha, etc).  And you may want to merge the Selenium IDE testing
script to the language and framework of your choice.

1. Exporting to JUnit really gives you a good sense of what's happening under
   the covers (in terms of the actual calls to the WebDriver).  Also, if there
is a test case that is particularly hard to nail down just by using Selenium
IDE, you can touch it up in the form of exported Java code.  

1. Selenium IDE also gives the option to export your JUnit test directly to a
   Selenium Grid which can run the test cases in parallel.  This can allow you
to utilize a server farm to finish your testing very quickly, although we will
not explore this option today.

## Submission

There is no submission for this exercise.  Please practice until you have
gained confidence.
 
My solution test cases are stored as the [Reddit Cats.side](Reddit%20Cats.side)
file afore mentioned.  Compare with your test cases and see if you implemented
them correctly.  It is in JSON format so you should be able to open it with a
text editor and trace it with your eyes, if that's what you prefer.
